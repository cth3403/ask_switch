##LibChat Chat Switch

####Purpose:
To enable our librarians to switch between chat service provider depending on hours of operation i.e. LibChat for 9-5, Questionpoint for out of ours or to set chat as offline.

####Usage:
To the custom CSS/JS code option replace the script portion of the chat widget with:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="[your.server]/status-test2.js"></script>`

Then everywhere where the slideout tab is shown the script should intercept and add QP as an alternative.


####NB:
This uses our library's id and other settings. You will need to ascertain your own institutions information as the basis for this script.
